# EntreNess

A side project reflecting / reinforcing my developments learning backend tech lately. Feb. 12th attempting GraphQL with express to get an idea, I decided then decided to adjust to Scala from Feb. 22nd.

Stack:
---
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/blog/introducing-prisma-1ff423fd629e)

The Short:
---

*A test development application designed / based on today's modern technology stack.*

The front end application will be presented with technologies using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) & [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) for our UI presenting flexible, dynamic and powerful experience to users. Aside from [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)'s amazing utilization structure for our SPA, [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) our UI's 2nd implementation will assist in delivering flexibility, performance, and organizational API RESTful query delivery system.

The back end utilizing [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) & [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) with a hosting layer for our database [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/blog/introducing-prisma-1ff423fd629e) presents the efficiency of delivering our HTTP requests between our front & back end.

## The Aim

Currently in a design ready stage the plan is to execute proper goal sets following building the application.

#### Template The Application
1) Finish and build our ERD.
2) Template the production build.
3) Implement Test Driven Environments.
4) Test production value.
5) Survey for real use case feedbacks.

#### Review

Revisit the board, reanalyze the application for adjustments, possible production outcome & results and plan for production value development.

## Progress:

#### Back-End:
- Base template for GraphQL & Prisma schemas drafted.
- Base working (CRUD) template for Queries & Mutations drafted.
- Utils for authorizations || tokens & hashing drafted.
- Created our service on Prisma cloud & Heroku.
- PostGreSQL hosting our Prod & Dev.
- Application & Production for GraphQL Playground of our working schemas deployed but not finished.

#### Front-End:
- Base working Front-End layout created.
- Working implementations of root GraphQL operations connected.
- Base draft styling created.
- Standard Redux base implementation produced.
- Apollo integration.

Todo
---

#### Back-End:

- Optimize mutations and finish remaining comments.
- Add the remaining custom resolvers. (Currently not added due to finalizations & testing of root operations of Queries, Mutations & Subscriptions.)
- Check for security vulnerability. 1 being a dependancy.
- Check for updated Prisma versions. Been using methods from the stable release of 1.13 so far.
- Adjustments for NodeJS API consistency with Prisma API for our GraphQL to our database.
- Configure cases for root operation subscriptions after sorting out out rough draft of our API functionalities.
- Minor, but should update ERD on the current standing of the drafted application.
- Reconfigure schemas to adjusted usage of app.

#### Front-End:
- Overhaul for styling and layout now that a base working draft has been created.
- Reconfigure and optimize components to overhaul.
- Recalibrate stack usages.

Current Task:
---
- ~~Now that a presentable working back-end is in tact. Its time to start building our front-end and connecting it.~~

- A working presentable Front-End has been created for a general outlook. Time to present a overhaul to the layout & styling for the Front-End then fully implement the functions from the Back-End.
