# EntreNess

After enough stress testing / sandboxing technologies, it is about time to start a personal project.

Stack:
---
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- [Prism](https://www.prisma.io/blog/introducing-prisma-1ff423fd629e)

The Short:
---

*A test development application designed / based on today's modern technology stack.*

The front end application will be presented with technologies using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) & [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) for our UI presenting flexible, dynamic and powerful experience to users. Aside from [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)'s amazing utilization structure for our SPA, [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) our UI's 2nd implementation will assist in delivering flexibility, performance, and organizational API RESTful query delivery system.

The back end utilizing [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) & [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) with a hosting layer for our database [Prism](https://www.prisma.io/blog/introducing-prisma-1ff423fd629e) presents the efficiency of delivering our HTTP requests between our front & back end.

## The Aim

Currently in a design ready stage the plan is to execute proper goal sets following building the application.

#### Template The Application
1) Finish and build our ERD.
2) Template the production build.
3) Implement Test Driven Environments.
4) Test production value.
5) Survey for real use case feedbacks.

#### Review

Revisit the board, reanalyze the application for adjustments, possible production outcome & results and plan for production value development.
